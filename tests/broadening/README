'Broadening' System Test
Consistency checks of Q dependent and independent broadening of S(Q) with EPSR.

Cubic box of argon atoms, loaded from equilibrated EPSR configuration. Reference data supplied by multiple EPSR
simulations utilising a range of Q-dependent and Q-independent broadenings in order to test consistency with 
the application of general broadening employed within the code.

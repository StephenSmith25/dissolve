'Correlation Functions' System Test
Comparison between calculated structure factors for water and those from EPSR.

EPSR input file set up to use all molecular origins in formation of g(r) (2000 for safety, since nmols is only 1000).
Lorch function is not applied in EPSR.
Minor discrepancies in calculated g(r) arise from EPSR writing coordinates to only 3 d.p (not checked).
Minor errors in calculated S(Q) arise from differences in calculated g(r).

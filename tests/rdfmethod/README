'RDF Methods' System Test
Test of consistency between internal methods for generating radial distribution functions.

Compare test (simple, serial) calculated g(r) (Method == Test) with other available partial generation 
methods, ensuring that the results are exactly the same.

Test is performed on a randomly generated box of atoms, using a small cell division size and RDF cutoff to
ensure that not all atoms are considered in a given atom-centered RDF, and that some Cells can legitimately
be excluded.

'Exchangeable' System Test
Test for correct treatment of exchangeable atom types in mixed system.

Comparison between calculated structure factors for water isotopologues and those from EPSR, to test in particular
the partial reweightings when exchangeable atoms are present.

Samples reference dummy data (all zeroes) and are named 'ABC' where A is the substitution (H or D) on the water
hydrogen, and B and C are that on the alcohol hydrogen and methyl hydrogens respectvely. A '5' instead of an H or D
represents a 50:50 H:D mix at that position.

Notes:
EPSR input file set up to use all molecular origins in formation of g(r) (2000 for safety, since nmols is only 1000).
Minor discrepancies in calculated g(r) arise from EPSR writing coordinates to only 3 d.p (not checked).

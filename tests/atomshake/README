'AtomShake' System Test
Test recovery of intramolecular geometry of a simple molecule using the AtomShake module.

One water molecule in a large box, starting at known coordinates giving O-H bond lengths of 0.9 and H-O-H angle
of 100.0 degrees. AtomShake at 0 K used to return geometry to forcefield values (1.012 Angstroms and 113.24
degrees).
